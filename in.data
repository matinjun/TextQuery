The "Toxic" singer, 39, said in court at the time that the conservatorship, which has had a grip on her since 2008, is "abusive" and has left her "traumatized."

She also spoke about her family and said she'd like to "sue" them, though did not specify which members directly. She mentioned her father, Jamie, and mother, Lynne, multiple times, but made no direct mention of Jamie Lynn or her brother, Bryan.
